> ### Guidelines for raising a pull request:
>
> - Each pull request should have an appropriate and short title like "Fixed Bug in Experience Page"
>
> - Pull Requests without a description would often not be reviewed. Make sure you describe your intended changes in the description section of the pull request. (Use bullet points and phrases)
>
> - Make sure to refer the respective issue in the respective PR using phrases like `Resolves #issue_number` or `Closes #issue_number`.  Here's an example to raise a PR:
```
 Fixes #640

# Work Done:

- Fixed Responsiveness bug in the MOOC Section of the Education Page
- Made the Favicon more optimized
- ...
- ...
- ...

# Relevant Screenshots/Gifs
```

> - Attach a screenshot/clip of the change(s).
>
> - Look out for possible merge conflicts. Please add comments required, this makes your code readable.
>
>- Make sensible variable names. For example, card1 is quite ambiguous but education__card implies what that variable is declared for.
